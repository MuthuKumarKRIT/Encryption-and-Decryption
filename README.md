# Encryption-and-Decryption
My Project Encryption and Decryption includes Encryption and Decryption of Caesar Cipher and ROT 13 Encryption Techniques. User can Enter a text and get its corresponding Encrypted or Decrypted texts.
Thereby the messages are well protected because of Encryptions so that the receiver can only decrypt the text and understand the message.
